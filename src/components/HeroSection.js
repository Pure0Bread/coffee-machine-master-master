                 <p>It consists of one-third espresso, two-thirds heated milk and about 1cm of foam. </p>
                 <p>Depending on the skill of the barista, </p>
                 <p> the foam can be poured in such a way to create a picture</p>

                <p>A traditional mocha will contain espresso shots, a large amount of steamed milk, </p>
                 <p>some mocha syrup, and is topped with milk foam. </p>
                 <p>The combination of the rich espresso, creamy milk, and sweet chocolate makes for a delicious and addicting drink </p>
                 <p> Mochas are a lot larger than traditional Italian cappuccinos.</p>
